        'History of Dongchang Cinema: Dongchang Cinema was built in 1954, was the first cinema and the cultural and entertainment center in Pudong new area. The cinema contains a screening hall (1175 seats), a video hall (72 seats) and a coffee tea room. It was built by the government in the 1950s by raising private funds. This cinema was once the most prosperous and charming cultural and artistic center in the east of the Huangpu River, and one of the very few old-fashioned theaters in Shanghai at present.',

The market will target at the post 80s and 90s generation and it will focus on the young consumer groups to build matched cultural consumption formats. With a view to the new form of new cultural complex, concerning the needs of multi-dimensional and cultural convergence as the main direction, we will establish a very first intermedia and interdisciplinary platform focusing on social, science and art fields in China.',
